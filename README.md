# README

This is a React Boilerplate project, built using Typescript, React, and Redux.

_Note: This project does not include **Server-Side Rendering**, **Testing Frameworks** and other stuff that makes the package unnecessarily complicated._

### Running the project

1.  Run `npm install / yarn install`
2.  Run `npm run build` to compile the typescript into the dist folder.
3.  Run `npm start` to run the application.
4.  Run `npm run prettier` to prettify the code.

## Contribution Guidelines:

I welcome and encourage all pull requests. It usually will take me within 24-48 hours to respond to any issue or request.

### Pull Requests

Here are some basic rules to follow to ensure timely addition of your request:

1.  Match coding style (braces, spacing, etc.) This is best achieved using `CMD`+`Option`+`L` (Reformat code) on Mac (not sure for Windows) with Android Studio defaults.
2.  If its a feature, bugfix, or anything please only change code to what you specify.
3.  Please keep PR titles easy to read and descriptive of changes, this will make them easier to merge :)
4.  Pull requests _must_ be made against `develop` branch. Any other branch (unless specified by the maintainers) will get rejected.
5.  Check for existing [issues](https://github.com/nicolaspearson/android.favicoin/issues) first, before filing an issue.
